                <p>Jett is a VALORANT agent who specializes in mobility and assassinations. Like a true ninja, this South Korean agent can dash short distances to catch-up enemies or escape dangerous situation, and even propel herself upwards to reach highground places and surprise lurking targets who think they're safe up there. The combination of the Cloudburst ability and the Blade Storm ultimate make Jett a close-combat nightmare, as she can execute enemies who won't even realize what hit them.</p>
